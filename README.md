# Hello World Program

This is simple hello program written in C++. This simple example shows how to write a safe, localized and user-friendly UNIX command-line application.  
This project can be used as a starter project when developing other UNIX command-line applications.

## Build
Use the following command to build the application.
```
make
```
To build the application, you need a Unix-like environment, an LLVM environment (requires `clang` and `clang++`), utility applications like `ld`, `rm`, `mkdir`, Makefile interpreter (`make`). The application is verified on macOS, but it should work as well in other UNIX-like systems like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. To build and run it on Windows, you may need an UNIX environment like `cygwin` or `mysystem`. We won't test it on Windows, but if you have any problem with it, we're welcome to discuss with you.
